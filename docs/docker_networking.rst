Docker Networking Refresher Tutorial
====================================

Docker Host Networking
----------------------

The host driver
---------------

  *  Container is started with :code:`docker run --net host ...`
  *  It sees (and can access) the network interfaces of the host.
  *  It can bind any address, any port (for ill and for good).
  *  Network traffic doesn't have to go through ``NAT``, ``bridge``, or ``veth``.
  *  Performance = native!
  *  Reference: https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html#329

MACVLAN Docker network
----------------------

When using macvlan, you cannot ``ping`` or communicate with the default namespace IP address. For example, if you create a container and try to ping the Docker hostâ€™s ``eth0``, it will not work. That traffic is explicitly filtered by the kernel modules themselves to offer additional provider isolation and security.

A macvlan subinterface can be added to the Docker host, to allow traffic between the Docker host and containers. The IP address needs to be set on this subinterface and removed from the parent address.

The container driver
--------------------

  *  Container is started with :code:`docker run --net container:id ...`
  *  It re-uses the network stack of another container.
  *  It shares with this other container the same interfaces, IP address(es), routes, iptables rules, etc.
  *  Those containers can communicate over their lo interface.  (i.e. one can bind to ``127.0.0.1`` and the others can connect to it.)
  *  Reference: https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html#330

Custom networks
---------------

When creating a network, extra options can be provided.

  *  :code:`--internal` disables outbound traffic (the network won't have a default gateway).
  *  :code:`--gateway` indicates which address to use for the gateway (when outbound traffic is allowed).
  *  :code:`--subnet` (in CIDR notation) indicates the subnet to use.
  *  :code:`--ip-range` (in CIDR notation) indicates the subnet to allocate from.
  *  :code:`--aux-address` allows specifying a list of reserved addresses (which won't be allocated to containers).
  *  Reference: https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html#362

Connecting and Disconnecting from networks dynamically
------------------------------------------------------

  *  The Docker Engine also allows connecting and disconnecting while the container is running.
  *  This feature is exposed through the Docker API, and through two Docker CLI commands:
        *  :code:`docker network connect <network> <container>`
        *  :code:`docker network disconnect <network> <container>`
  *  Reference: https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html#367 

Docker Capabilities
-------------------

With OVS being run as a container, it needs some privileges to access network and system resources.  In Docker, this is controlled by providing `"Capability" <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities>`_ permissions to the running container.  For OVS to work, Capabilities such as ``"SYS_MODULE"``, ``"NET_ADMIN"`` and ``"SYS_NICE"`` are required.

A very useful picture to understand Capabilities is available at https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1217168566556004352/photo/1

Namespaces Refresher Tutorial
=============================

Let's first understand what network namespaces are. So basically, when you install Linux, by default the entire OS share the same routing table and the same IP address. The namespace forms a cluster of all global system resources which can only be used by the processes within the namespace, providing resource isolation.

Docker containers use this technology to form their own cluster of resources which would be used only by that namespace, i.e. that container. Hence every container has its own IP address and work in isolation without facing resource sharing conflicts with other containers running on the same system.

Linuxâ€™s network namespaces are used to glue container processes and the host networking stack. Docker spawns a container in the containers own network namespace (use the CLONE_NEWNET flag defined in sched.h when calling the clone system call to create a new network namespace for the subprocess) and later on runs a veth pair (a cable with two ends) between the container namespace and the host network stack.

IP Tables
=========

Docker extensively uses ``iptables`` to provide isolation amongst its services and filtering of traffic. Mostly, we may never have to touch this feature unless, the underlying system has a custom ``iptables`` rules.
